A guy walks into an animal shelter and sees a sign that says, “HELP WANTED: Must be responsible, hard-working, and able to multitask. Pay: $15/hr.”

The guy thinks, “I’m responsible. I’m hard-working. And I can multitask.” So he walks up to the front desk and says, “I’d like to apply for the job.”

The receptionist looks him up and down and asks, “Do you have any experience with animals?”

The guy shrugs, “I have a cat.”

The receptionist nods, “Great! But this is a bit different. We’re looking for someone who can do a variety of tasks. You’ll be handling everything from feeding the animals, cleaning cages, and assisting with adoption events. It’s a lot of work.”

The guy is eager, “I can do that. I’m very responsible.”

“Alright,” the receptionist says. “Go down the hallway to the last room. There’s a big white cat named Mr. Whiskers. He’s a bit… special. We need someone to spend some time with him.”

The guy is confused. “Spend time with him?”

“Just go in,” she says, “and you’ll see.”

The guy walks down the hallway, opens the door, and there’s Mr. Whiskers—a giant, fluffy white cat sitting in the middle of the room, staring intently at him.

The guy hesitates. “Okay… what am I supposed to do?”

The receptionist calls from the hallway, “Just sit down and keep him company.”

The guy sits down on the floor, awkwardly staring at the cat. Mr. Whiskers doesn’t blink. The tension in the room is palpable.

Then, without warning, Mr. Whiskers leaps up and starts to run around the room, knocking things over, knocking over a chair, and swatting at anything in his path. It’s like a cat tornado.

The guy jumps to his feet, “What the—?”

Suddenly, the door bursts open and a large, burly man in a security uniform walks in. “Alright, that’s enough, Mr. Whiskers! Time for your snack!”

The cat stops, looks at the man, and sits perfectly still. The guy stares at the scene in utter confusion.

The security guard turns to the guy. “You’re hired.”

The guy is bewildered. “Huh? What just happened?”

The security guard grins. “You don’t need experience with animals. You just need to survive Mr. Whiskers' interview.
